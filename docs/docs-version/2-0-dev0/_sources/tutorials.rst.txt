Introductory Tutorial: Incident risk of drilling operations
*************************************************************

Introduce yourself to the FACET workflow! With this tutorial you will:

- develop a classifier for predicting incident risk of drilling operations using
  drilling sensor data, and
- use model inspection and simulation to understand what drilling operation parameters
  impact incident risk, with a particular focus on rate of penetration.

Classification Tutorial: Prediabetes
**************************************

Predict your binary target with FACET. In this tutorial aiming to
predict individuals at risk of prediabetes you will:

- select a classifier for predicting prediabetes, and
- gain insights into key factors predictive of prediabetes using advanced model
  inspection and simulation.
