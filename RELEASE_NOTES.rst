FACET 2.1
---------

FACET 2.1 introduces the :class:`.NativeLearnerInspector` for inspecting native
*scikit-learn* models and pipelines.

We still recommend using :mod:`sklearndf` models and learner pipelines along with FACET's
:class:`.LearnerSelector` for hyperparameter tuning; however the new
:class:`.NativeLearnerInspector` can be useful for inspecting models that have been
trained using *scikit-learn* directly.

2.1.0
~~~~~

- API: new :class:`.NativeLearnerInspector` class for inspecting native *scikit-learn*
  regressors, classifiers, and pipelines with a regressor or classifier as the final
  estimator


FACET 2.0
---------

FACET |nbsp| 2.0 brings numerous API enhancements and improvements, accelerates model
inspection by up to a factor of 50 in many practical applications, introduces a new,
more flexible and user-friendly API for hyperparameter tuning – with support for
`scikit-learn`'s native hyperparameter searchers – and improves the styling of all
visualizations.

FACET 2.0 requires :mod:`pytools` |nbsp| 2.0 and :mod:`sklearndf` |nbsp| 2.2, and is now
fully type-checked by |mypy|.

2.0.1
~~~~~

- API: class :class:`.LearnerInspector` now supports inspecting individual regressors
  and classifiers; it is no longer necessary to wrap them into a
  :class:`.RegressorPipelineDF` or :class:`.ClassifierPipelineDF` instance with empty
  preprocessing


2.0.0
~~~~~

``facet.data``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- API: class :class:`.Sample` raises an exception if the name of any used column is not
  a string
- API: class :class:`.RangePartitioner` supports new optional arguments ``lower_bound``
  and ``upper_bound`` in method :meth:`~.RangePartitioner.fit` and no longer accepts
  them in the class initializer

``facet.explanation``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- REFACTOR: moved explainer factories from module :mod:`facet.inspection` to new module
  :mod:`facet.explanation`.
- API: new explainer factories :class:`.ExactExplainerFactory` and
  :class:`.PermutationExplainerFactory`, in addition to the
  :class:`.TreeExplainerFactory` and :class:`.KernelExplainerFactory` introduced in
  FACET |nbsp| 1.0

``facet.inspection``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- API: new :class:`.FunctionInspector` class for inspecting arbitrary functions,
  using a :class:`.ExactExplainerFactory` by default
- API: :class:`.LearnerInspector` no longer uses learner crossfits and instead inspects
  models using a single pass of SHAP calculations, usually leading to performance gains
  of up to a factor of |nbsp| 50
- API: return :class:`.LearnerInspector` matrix outputs as :class:`~pytools.data.Matrix`
  instances
- API: diagonals of feature synergy, redundancy, and association matrices are now
  ``nan`` instead of |nbsp| 1.0
- API: the leaf order of :class:`~pytools.data.LinkageTree` objects generated by
  ``feature_…_linkage`` methods of :class:`.LearnerInspector` is now the same as the
  row and column order of :class:`~pytools.data.Matrix` objects returned by the
  corresponding ``feature_…_matrix`` methods of :class:`.LearnerInspector`, minimizing
  the distance between adjacent leaves.
  The old sorting behaviour of FACET |nbsp| 1.x can be restored using method
  :meth:`~pytools.data.LinkageTree.sort_by_weight`

``facet.selection``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- API: :class:`.LearnerSelector` replaces FACET |nbsp| 1.x class ``LearnerRanker``, and
  provides a new, more flexible and user-friendly API for hyperparameter tuning
- API: :class:`.LearnerSelector` introduces support for any CV searcher implementing
  `scikit-learn`'s CV search API, including `scikit-learn`'s native searchers such as
  :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` or
  :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV`
- API: new classes :class:`.ParameterSpace` and :class:`.MultiEstimatorParameterSpace`
  offer a more convenient and robust mechanism for declaring options or distributions
  for hyperparameter tuning
- API: new class :class:`.LearnerSelector` supports a new, more flexible and
  user-friendly API for hyperparameter tuning

``facet.simulation``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- API: simulations no longer depend on learner crossfits and instead are carried out
  as a single pass on the full dataset, using the *standard error of mean predictions*
  to obtain confidence intervals that less conservative yet more realistic
- VIZ: minor tweaks to simulation plots and reports generated by
  :class:`.SimulationDrawer`

``facet.validation``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- API: removed class ``FullSampleValidator``

Other
^^^^^

- VIZ: significant updates to the styling of all visualizations, especially those
  generated for output of :class:`.LearnerInspector`, using the all-new versions of
  :mod:`pytools` matrix and dendrogram drawers
- API: class ``LearnerCrossfit`` is no longer needed in FACET |nbsp| 2.0 and has been
  removed
- API: support new :obj:`~pytools.fit.fitted_only` decorator introduced in
  :mod:`pytools` |nbsp| 2.1.


FACET 1.2
---------

FACET |nbsp| 1.2 adds support for *sklearndf* |nbsp| 1.2 and *scikit-learn* |nbsp| 0.24.
It also introduces the ability to run simulations on a subsample of the data used to
fit the underlying crossfit.
One example where this can be useful is to use only a recent period of a time series as
the baseline of a simulation.

1.2.3
~~~~~

- BUILD: pin down *matplotlib* version to < 3.6 and *scipy* version to < 1.9 to ensure
  compatibility with *pytools* 1.2 and *sklearndf* 1.2


1.2.2
~~~~~

- catch up with FACET |nbsp| 1.1.2


1.2.1
~~~~~

- FIX: fix a bug in :class:`.UnivariateProbabilitySimulator` that was introduced in
  FACET |nbsp| 1.2.0
- catch up with FACET |nbsp| 1.1.1


1.2.0
~~~~~

- BUILD: added support for *sklearndf* |nbsp| 1.2 and *scikit-learn* |nbsp| 0.24
- API: new optional parameter ``subsample`` in method
  :meth:`.BaseUnivariateSimulator.simulate_feature` can be used to specify a subsample
  to be used in the simulation (but simulating using a crossfit based on the full
  sample)


FACET 1.1
---------

FACET |nbsp| 1.1 refines and enhances the association/synergy/redundancy calculations
provided by the :class:`.LearnerInspector`.


1.1.2
~~~~~

- DOC: use a downloadable dataset in the `getting started` notebook
- FIX: import `catboost <https://catboost.ai/en/docs/>`_ if present, else create a local
  module mockup
- FIX: correctly identify if ``sample_weights`` is undefined when re-fitting a model
  on the full dataset in a ``LearnerCrossfit``
- BUILD: relax package dependencies to support any `numpy` version |nbsp| 1.`x` from
  |nbsp| 1.16


1.1.1
~~~~~

- DOC: add reference to FACET research paper on the project landing page
- FIX: correctly count positive class frequency in UnivariateProbabilitySimulator


1.1.0
~~~~~

- API: SHAP interaction vectors can (in part) also be influenced by redundancy among
  features. This can inflate quantifications of synergy, especially in cases where two
  variables are highly redundant. FACET now corrects interaction vectors for redundancy
  prior to calculating synergy. Technically we ensure that each interaction vector is
  orthogonal w.r.t the main effect vectors of both associated features.
- API: FACET now calculates synergy, redundancy, and association separately for each
  model in a crossfit, then returns the mean of all resulting matrices. This leads to a
  slight increase in accuracy, and also allows us to calculate the standard deviation
  across matrices as an indication of confidence for each calculated value.
- API: Method :meth:`.LearnerInspector.shap_plot_data` now returns SHAP values for the
  positive class of binary classifiers.
- API: Increase efficiency of ``ModelSelector`` parallelization by adopting the
  new :class:`pytools.parallelization.JobRunner` API provided by :mod:`pytools`
- BUILD: add support for :mod:`shap` |nbsp| 0.38 and |nbsp| 0.39


FACET 1.0
---------

1.0.3
~~~~~

- FIX: restrict package requirements to *gamma-pytools* |nbsp| 1.0 and
  *sklearndf* |nbsp| 1.0, since FACET |nbsp| 1.0 is not compatible with
  *gamma-pytools* |nbsp| 1.1

1.0.2
~~~~~

This is a maintenance release focusing on enhancements to the CI/CD pipeline and bug
fixes.

- API: add support for |shap| |nbsp| 0.36 and |nbsp| 0.37 via a new
  :class:`.BaseExplainer` stub class
- FIX: apply color scheme to the histogram section in :class:`.SimulationMatplotStyle`
- BUILD: add support for :mod:`numpy` |nbsp| 1.20
- BUILD: updates and changes to the CI/CD pipeline


1.0.1
~~~~~

Initial release.
