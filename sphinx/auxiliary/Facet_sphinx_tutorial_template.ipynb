    "\n",
    "- **Model Inspection**\n",
    "\n",
    "    FACET introduces a new algorithm to quantify dependencies and interactions between features in ML models. This new tool for human-explainable AI adds a new, global perspective to the observation-level explanations provided by the popular [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) approach. To learn more about FACET's model inspection capabilities, see the getting started example below.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Model Simulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    FACET's model simulation algorithms use ML models for *virtual experiments* to help identify scenarios that optimise predicted  outcomes. To quantify the uncertainty in simulations, FACET utilises a range of bootstrapping algorithms including stationary and stratified bootstraps. For an example of FACETâ€™s bootstrap simulations, see the getting started example below.    \n",

FACET also introduces [sklearndf](https://github.com/BCG-Gamma/sklearndf), an augmented version of *scikit-learn* with enhanced support for *pandas* dataframes that ensures end-to-end traceability of features.     \n",

    "Instead of using the \"regular\" scikit-learn package, we are going to use sklearndf (see on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/BCG-Gamma/sklearndf/)). sklearndf is an open source library designed to address a common issue with scikit-learn: the outputs of transformers are numpy arrays, even when the input is a data frame. However, to inspect a model it is essential to keep track of the feature names. sklearndf retains all the functionality available through scikit-learn plus the feature traceability and usability associated with Pandas data frames. Additionally, the names of all your favourite scikit-learn functions are the same except for `DF` on the end. For example, the standard scikit-learn import:\n",
