    "2. Enhance our model inspection to understand drivers of predictions using local explanations of features via [SHAP values](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions) by applying a novel methodology that decomposes SHAP values into measures of synergy, redundancy, and independence between each pair of features.\n",

As SHAP values represent post-processing after data preparation, feature engineering, preprocessing and model selection/tuning, minimal simulation studies offer a way to make the connection as direct as possible.\n",

    "The [SHAP approach](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions) has become the standard method for model inspection. SHAP values are used to explain the additive contribution of each feature to the prediction for a given observation. SHAP values are computed for every feature and observation.\n",

    "The FACET `LearnerInspector` computes SHAP values for each crossfit (i.e., a CV fold or bootstrap resample) using the best model identified by the `LearnerRanker`. The FACET `LearnerInspector` then provides advanced model inspection through new SHAP-based summary metrics for understanding feature redundancy and synergy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synergy** is the interaction of two or more real-world factors towards an outcome. In a predictive model, factors are represented by features. **FACET quantifies synergy as the degree to which the model combines information from two features to predict the target.**\n",
    "In this context, synergy is expressed as a percentage ranging from 100% (full synergy) to 0% (full autonomy). For example, given features X and Y as coordinates on a chess board, the colour of a square can only be predicted when considering X and Y in combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Redundancy** occurs when two or more factors stem from a common condition and, hence, can be substituted with each other when predicting or explaining outcomes. **FACET quantifies redundancy as the degree to which two features of a model provide duplicate information to predict the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like synergy, redundancy can be expressed as a percentage ranging from 100% (full redundancy) to 0% (full uniqueness). For example, temperature and pressure in a pressure cooker are redundant features for predicting cooking time since pressure will rise relative to the temperature, and vice versa. Therefore, knowing just one of either temperature or pressure will likely enable the same predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, redundancy represents the shared information between two features and synergy represents the degree to which one feature combines with another to generate a prediction. It is also important to recognize:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - that any pair of features may have both redundancy and synergy\n",
    " - that **SHAP values are dependent upon the model, they represent what the model catches about reality, not the reality**. As an example, under or over fitting will influence redundancy and synergy\n",
    " - If two variables $X$ and $Y$ both contribute to predictions of a model, then correlation translates to redundancy (but not vice versa) and interaction translates to synergy (and vice versa).\n",
    " \n",
    "In our dataset, we build synergy and redundancy as folllows\n",
    "  - We use the correlation ($\\rho$) between features to induce redundancy\n",
    "  - We balance between an interaction ($\\beta_3$) and main effects ($\\beta_1, \\beta_2$) to induce synergy. For example, as the correlation gets higher, we expect higher redundancy, and as the interaction gets stronger and the main effects get weaker, we expect higher synergy."

    "We can observe the following from the figure above:\n",

    "1. Based on the cross-validation curve, the best choice of `max_depth` is 5.\n",
    "2. The value of synergy at the best `max_depth` of 5 is around 46% which is lower than the largest estimate of 53% when we overfit (right of `max_depth` = 5), and much greater than the smallest estimate of 30% when we underfit (left of `max_depth` = 5).\n",
    "3. The value of redundancy at the best `max_depth` of 5 is around 27% which is higher than the smallest estimate of 23% when we overfit (right of `max_depth` = 5), and lower than the highest estimate of 30% when we underfit (left of `max_depth` = 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests for a pair of moderately correlated features with a moderate interaction and limited individual contributions, overfitting might cause us to over-estimate synergy (i.e., the model interprets noise as an interaction) and under-estimate redundancy, while underfitting can cause the opposite. As with all machine learning, identifying a well-tuned model is critical to obtaining appropriate estimates of synergy and redundancy."
