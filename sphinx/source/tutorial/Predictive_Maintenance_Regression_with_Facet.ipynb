    "**Robust and impactful Data Science with FACET**\n",
    "\n",
    "FACET enables us to perform a number of critical steps in best practice Data Science work flow easily, efficiently and reproducibly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a robust pipeline for learner selection using LearnerRanker and enabling the use of bootstrap cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enhance our model inspection to understand drivers of predictions using local explanations of features via SHAP values by applying a novel methodology that decomposes SHAP values into measures of synergy, redundancy, and independence between each pair of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Quickly apply historical simulation to gain key insights into feature values that minimize or maximize the predicted outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are from simulated experiments of a naval vessel (Frigate) Gas Turbine (GT) propulsion plant. The simulator considers the performance decay over time of the GT components such as GT compressor and turbines. One observation in this dataset represents the current decay states of the compressor and the gas turbine along with several sensor readings of the vessel at that point in time. The decay state is a performance metric [0, 1] where 1 means delivering 100% of nominal performance. We want to determine the machine settings which maximize the gas turbine decay state coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing FACET we will: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predict the decay state of the gas turbine as accurately as possible\n",
    "2. Understand which parameters drive the decay state of the turbine\n",
    "3. Analyze how these drivers interact with each other and the target\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can solve questions 1 and parts of question 2 with commonly used machine learning packages, `facet` will enable us to make better inferences about the way some of the features share or complement information and help us to figure out the optimal settings of the vessel to minimize the equipment degradation at a variety of ship speeds.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Redundancy**: the degree to which two features use the same information, independently of each other, to contribute to a prediction. For example, temperature and pressure in a pressure cooker are redundant features for predicting cooking time since pressure will rise relative to the temperature, and vice versa. Therefore knowing just one of either temperature or pressure will likely enable the same predictive accuracy.\n",

    "1. Calculate the feature redundancy matrix using SHAP value decomposition - this gives us pairwise redundancy between features, in the range of 0.0 (fully unique contributions) and 1.0 (fully redundant contributions)\n",

    "2. Transform the feature redundancy matrix into a feature distance matrix, where distance is expressed as (1.0 - redundancy)\n",
